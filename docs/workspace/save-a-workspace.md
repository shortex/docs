# Save a Workspace

### Things you need to be able to save a workspace
 - At least one **View** ([create a view](/view/create-a-view))
    - View needs to have a name ([name a view](/view/name-a-view))

### Saving a unsaved workspace can be done by:

**Options**
 - Private: ```if ON workspace will be Private```
 - User default: ```Set this workspace as your default for when loading app```
 - Watchlist View: ```Save as a watchlist view this makes it possible to have custom watchlist views``` Read more about Watchlists [here](/category/watchlist)


```Workspaces -> Save as```
